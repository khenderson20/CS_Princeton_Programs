*   1.3.34 Ramanujan's taxi.
*   Srinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who became famous for his intuition of numbers.
*   When the English mathematician G. H. Hardy came to visit him one day, Hardy remarked that the number of his taxi
*   was 1729, a rather dull number.
*   To which Ramanujan replied, "No, Hardy! No, Hardy! It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number
*   expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways."
*
*   Verify this claim by writing a program that takes an integer command-line argument 'n' and prints all the
*   integers less than or equal to 'n' that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.
*
*   In other words, find the distinct positive integers (a, b, c, d) such that a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3.
*   Use four nested FOR loops.
